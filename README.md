# Gold Production by Country (1900–2023)

This project explores historical data on global gold production by country from 1900 to 2023. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides production figures (in tonnes) for each country annually. This repository contains tools and visualizations to analyze trends in gold mining over time, evaluate country-level performance, and present insights into one of the world’s most valuable natural resources.

## Dataset Summary

Source: Kaggle – List of countries by gold production (1900–2023)  
Description:  
Gold mining is a global industry with operations on nearly every continent. This dataset includes annual gold production (in metric tonnes) by country from 1900 through 2023. As of 2023, China is the largest producer globally, accounting for approximately 10% of total production.

### Attribute Information

- Entity – Name of the country or region  
- Year – Year of production  
- Production – Gold production volume in metric tonnes

## Project Goals

This project aims to:

1. Clean and structure the dataset for analysis  
2. Visualize global gold production trends over time  
3. Identify top-producing countries by decade  
4. Highlight patterns of economic or political influence  
5. Present insights using charts, maps, and summary statistics  

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)  
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab  
- Kaggle Datasets  
- Git and GitHub for version control  
- (Optional) Streamlit or Power BI for dashboards

## Example Visualizations (To Be Developed)

- Year-over-year production growth by country  
- Top 10 producers per decade  
- Global production share by year  
- Declining vs. emerging producers  

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gold-production-analysis.git  
   cd gold-production-analysis  

2. Install dependencies  
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter  

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook  
   jupyter notebook notebooks/gold_production_analysis.ipynb  

Alternatively, you can open the notebook in Google Colab by uploading it to your Google Drive.

## Planned Improvements

- Add interactive dashboard using Streamlit  
- Include map-based visualization with GeoPandas or Folium  
- Compare gold production with GDP and inflation trends  
- Forecast future production using machine learning (optional)
